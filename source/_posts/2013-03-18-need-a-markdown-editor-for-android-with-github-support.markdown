This is my second blog post and I still need a Markdown editor for Android with Github support.

Start to think to write it but I don't need yet another side project. My phone is not rooted and can't find a simple and free tool that support Markdown + Github.

But suddenly, I simply remember that you can edit Markdown files directly in Github...
